# This values.yaml file is intentionally left empty.

# When this chart is used as a subchart (e.g., by the 'blueprint' chart),
# its configuration is passed down from the parent.
#
# The enabling and disabling of the individual plugin subcharts is handled
# dynamically by the 'condition' fields in this chart's Chart.yaml,
# which read the 'restdefinitions' toggles from the parent chart's values.
#
# This file is kept to adhere to Helm chart structure standards.
